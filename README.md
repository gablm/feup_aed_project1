# AED - Project 1

A project about a scheduling system and management of students and classes.


TODO:
    removeFromSchedule function in student class

    create a record for any changes made to the system
    implement a way to add/remove/swap things in a student's schedule through the UI taking into account if they should be able to or not

    implement a way to consult, through the UI:
        a student or class's schedule
        the students in a class, course or year
        the number of students in at least n UCs
        the ocupation in a class/year/UC (sorting by UC, ascending or descending order, â€¦)
        UC's with the most students (seems redundant with the previous one??)
        (anything else considered relevant)

    CONFIRM WITH THE TEACHER create new cvs files with the updated info when the program stops
    
    additional ideas not in the SoW (optional):
        add a way to add new students
